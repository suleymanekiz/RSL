It's like the screenplay was written to include title cards along the way, announcing each 'chapter' so as to let the audience understand that there are intended gaps in the narrative which the director is highlighting. Without that highlighting, things happen and you're not sure how or why the film leaps from character to character, because they're not interlinked."", ""The other big problem is that there is very little exposition, meaning the viewer has little comprehension of where people are going, or how certain characters figure certain things out.

Besides the crazy street riding, exceptional accidents and narrative flashbacks, the graphics add another element of visual impact. Even with a few breather moments, the pacing never lags and there's enough variety to avoid repetitive peddling scenes. If you're wondering how a simple trip downtown can take up 90 minutes, you'll be surprised to see how strong editing and creative storytelling can propel it forward.

The philosophy-laden run up and the mystical follow up must be endured to get the whole story, but it's worth the effort. The struggle for survival is spellbinding and Lee has created some imagery that's astoundingly beautiful. Where the real animals end and the CGI begins is seamless. The 3D doesn't really add that much, but most theaters don't give many alternatives. Whether or not you appreciate the metaphysical aspects, Lee again demonstrates that he's one of the great modern masters of cinema."" ]";2.0;3.0;2.0;1.0;6;3.0

Director Steve McQueen has incredible skills for observation and visual artistry. Every image is beautiful.

Surprisingly, Dornan is prettier than Johnson, but they both create characters that are complex and compelling.

The timeline alternates between his peak years, when he was starting to experiment with their sound (played by Paul Dano) and the period after his breakdown (played by John Cusak), when therapist Dr. Eugene Landy dominated his existence. Both actors are mesmerizing, brilliantly capturing Wilson's complexity and charisma. As the woman who saves him, the usually outsize Elizabeth Banks is a quiet revelation. Producer-turned-director Bill Pohlad has crafted a compellingly complex examination into the creative process and one of the most effective studies of mental illness ever on screen. Although the musician's oppressive struggles keep the film in a continual dark place (with a sometimes slow pace), the film's quiet power and artistic mastery create an enthralling cinematic exploration.

There's early insight into her personal demons and the pressures of fame that turned her story into a tragedy of press harassment, need for love and substance abuse (on-screen song lyrics reveal even more).

This is a sensitive story with loveably gruff characters who have a hard time expressing their feelings and often hurt instead. Affleck and Hedges are powerful in their subtlety and restrained emotions.

Meanwhile, the film enjoys a colorful 80s neon noir look and the period tunes provide a jammin' soundtrack. The rather conventional plot keeps turning on itself (as spies often do) and that becomes a bit much. This film is all about the well-staged chases and fierce fights."" ]";2.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;4;2.3333333333333335
202428;wind-river;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;Aug 19, 2017;"[ ""Jeremy Renner plays a stoic, steely-eyed Fish & Wildlife agent who discovers a corpse frozen in the snowy wilds of the titular Indian Reservation. The FBI agent that's sent from Vegas (Elizabeth Olsen, sufficiently wimpy, then sturdy) is literally out of her element. She recruits him to help track the murderer. The first hour sets up the characters with slow scenes of dialogue, then a riveting encounter happens to intensify the tension. The bleak Wyoming environment (actually shot in Utah) creates a forceful presence that adds layer of stark stress. It was refreshing to see such a strong supporting cast of Native American actors. While the outcome is compelling, the lead up takes patience."" ]";1.0;4.0;1.0;3.0;4;2.3333333333333335

Bringing her Paris couture skills back home results in an amusing, but somewhat unrealistic infusion of high fashion in the locals. While she tries to reconcile with her mother (Judy Davis) and get to the bottom of her trauma, she's wooed by the local hunk (Liam Hemsworth). There are elements of quirky comedy that sometimes work and sometimes seem forced. More unusual is the especially grim final hour, which upends most of the film's mischievous promise. The dresses are beautiful and the performances are solid, but be prepared to be taken in a dark direction before it's over."" ]";0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;3;2.0

Her performance dominates almost every frame and it's often commanding. She also gets a bit too steely at times. If Aaron Sorkin had been the screenwriter (instead of first timer Jonathan Perera) his crisp way with words would have made the intricacies of the interactions and the continuous twists more compelling. The brusque style with which every dilemma is dispatched reminded me \""House of Cards,\"" which I didn't love.

They spent plenty of money on film one to give it rich historical heft, but writer/director Ben Affleck didn't bring anything new to the genre. He also plays the lead, a somewhat principled crook, who resists pressure to join a gang until he has no choice. This takes him to Tampa, where he gets involved with the rum trade and a beautiful Cuban woman. This movie unfolds with predictable plot points and uninteresting characters, but has sufficient energy to keep it moving. What it's missing is any compelling drama or emotional impact. Instead, it's a rather bland, quickly forgettable entry into the gangster pantheon."" ]";3.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;3;2.0

He struggles with bag gigs, has a brief jail stint and meets a woman half his age (gotta hate that trite setup). The character is a shock/insult comic and his personality is abrasive and cruel, which makes him less than sympathetic. His bad attitude doesn't help. De Niro doesn't demonstrate any particular standup skill and never makes the character especially likable, He is surrounded by lots of cameos and spotting them is the most fun in the movie. Accomplished director Taylor Hackford has kept the interactions lively, but the writing doesn't add the depth or humor to make him or his plight enjoyable.

Looking back to this movie now, it does get its major flaws from the attempt to bring the Looney Tunes to theaters.

This movie is nearly harmless, which means this movie has its target audience set to the kids for easy positive reviews, and the fun wears off after the first time you see this movie.

It does what it sets out to do extremely well:  place its two protagonists (both sympathetic and convincing) in underwater peril and generate considerable suspense via which-way-is-up disorientation, almost-out-of-time maneuvers in tight spaces, and the circling specter of sharks.  It drew me in in a crisp, straightforward, edge-of-your-seat way, even earning a surprising degree of emotional investment by the end, and the underwater photography is frequently gorgeous.  So glad this was saved from a direct-to-video fate at the hands of Bob and Harvey Weinstein."" ]";3.0;5.0;3.0;2.0;1;1.125
