PERSONAL SELECTION
------------------
One of my favorite movies are Rocky, Godfather, Lord of the Rings. 

------------------
SUMMARY
------------------
Starting with the summary, the results are looking good when recommendations about Rocky movies are shown. 
I tried to select The Godfather, however, the results were poor. Only 3 movies were recommended along with very low recommendation scores.
Comparing it to the movie Rocky, the recommender shows great results. I expected more of the trilogy regarding Rocky so that dissapointed me.
There are some great action movies in the list of recommendations, however, movies such as 'Babe' and 'Finding Nemo' miss the boat in my opinion.
 

------------------
TITLE
------------------
When I created a Recommender system involving the 'Title' of a movie, the results are okay. The recommendations are to my flavor. 
The trilogy of The Lord of the Rings are shown. Not in the right order, but it does the job. 
Unfortunately, there is no extention of any other adventurous movies.
Moreover, the threshold needed to be set very low in order to come towards an output of 3 recommendations. 

------------------
STARRING
------------------
With starring, the outcomes presented were much smoother. A variety of movies were recommended. The starring host was 'Depp' also familiarized with Johnny Depp. 
Despite the richness of the outcome, it still required an extreme low thresold in order to present an outcome. 
This probably needed to be lowered due to the pick of url based on the movie 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. 
Maybe a different selection would generate better outcomes.
However, the recommendations provided were suitable to watch further, or even to save for watching it later.
